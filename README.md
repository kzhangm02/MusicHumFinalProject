# Music Hum Final Project

This repository contains all files and resources for my final project. I created an interactive website from scratch using fullPage.js which you can access [here](https://kzhangm02.github.io/MusicHumFinalProject/). Please use Google Chrome for the best viewing experience if possible. 

If the website does not load, there is an issue with GitHub Pages hosting that is outside of my control. You can instead download the files by clicking "Code" -> "Download ZIP" and then open `index.html` in your browser.
